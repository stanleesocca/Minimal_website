      <description>Finally, it is happeningâ€¦
A breath of unfamiliar air is blown across the entire oceanography and marine science community. One which arrival could inspire generation to come. The sort of paradigm shift which if supported by all and sundry can lead to a discipline that is not only inclusive but can really harness its talent pool across geographical and racial spectrum.
Shortly arriving in Europe to pursue my masters, the realisation of being a lone ranger in this field loom large ðŸ˜Ÿ.</description>

      <description>Moving on to the next chapter...
As I look onward to the next chapter of my life. I wanted to briefly pen down some couple of undocumented reflection that has been a foreplay in my thought process this summer.
It has been two years since I was given this wonderful opportunity to dream. First, I am grateful to IMBRSea for this incredible platform to ride of the crest of what was once a mere wishful thinking.</description>

      <description>Why this? Why write?
Honestly, I never meant to go this way. I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure why I am doing this. I have been much of a recluse for long to suddenly charge off to the internet to start anything remotely close to blogging. However, during the summer of 2020 amidst the COVID pandemic, I became too bored and I decided to learn some new stuff. The highlight were improving on my web dev skills, tried to get my head around Latex, checkout the much talk about Julia Language, had a go with some good O&amp;rsquo;l Fortran and lastly found time to engage in some summer reading (non-science books).</description>
