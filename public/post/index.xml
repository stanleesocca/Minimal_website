      <description>Moving on to the next chapter...
As I look onward to the next chapter of my life. I wanted to briefly pen down some couple of undocumented reflection that has been a foreplay in my thought process this summer.
It has been two years since I was given this wonderful opportunity to dream. First, I am grateful to IMBRSea for this incredible platform to ride of the crest what was once a mere infatuation.</description>

      <description>Why this? Why write?
Honestly, I never meant to go this way. I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure why I am doing this. I have been much of a recluse for long to suddenly charge off to the internet to start anything remotely close to blogging. However, during the summer of 2020 amidst the COVID pandemic, I became too bored and I decided to learn some new stuff. Improve on my web dev skills, tried to get my head around Latex, checkout the much talk about Julia Language while rewriting some old code in Good O&amp;rsquo;l Fortran.</description>
