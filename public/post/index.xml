      <description>As I look onward to the next chapter of my life. I wanted to briefly pen down some couple of undocumented reflection that has been a foreplay in thought process this summer.
It been two years since I was given this wonderful opportunity to dream. First, I say a big thank to IMBRSea for this incredible platform to ride of the crest what was once a mere infatuation. I have always only wanted to marine science ever since I unintendedly discovered this discipline.</description>

      <description>Why this? Why write?
Honestly, I never meant to go this way. I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure why I am doing this. I have been much of a recluse for long to suddenly charge off to the internet to start anything remotely close to blogging. However, during the summer of 2020 amidst the COVID pandemic, I became too bored and I decided to learn some new stuff. Refreshen my CSS skills, Latex, Julia and a bit of Good O&amp;rsquo;l Fortran.</description>
