      <p>Why this? Why write?</p>
<p>Honestly, I never meant to go this way. I&rsquo;m not even sure why I am doing this. I have been much of a recluse for long to suddenly charge off to the internet to start anything remotely close to blogging. However, during the summer of 2020 amidst the COVID pandemic, I became too bored and I decided to learn some new stuff. The highlight were improving on my web dev skills, tried to get my head around Latex, checkout the much talk about <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia Language</a>, had a go with some good O&rsquo;l Fortran and lastly found time to engage in some summer reading (non-science books). The result of one such experiment is what you are reading.</p>
<p>On a more serious note, the question of expressing myself in my own terms have been a recurring theme in my headspace for a while. I have procrastinated for much long to try something in that direction. Finally, I gave in and managed to find time to create this little corner of the web for my own fancy. Perhaps I will justify why I had to toll this path.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Firstly, as I continue my scientific training at LSCE, I feel this space can be a landing page for some of my scientific and other related activities. Obviously, this will be a journey that I both relish and look forward to. I hope to curate some of my successes (aka publication links when they finally come), stories, and experiences while on this. Who knows some stuffs here might be useful for others? Finger crossed on this ✌️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, I hope to used this medium to learn and improve on my writing skills. This part of my personal training is often relegated to the side list of &ldquo;to-do&rdquo; in favour of other skills. I believe writing here - when time and chance permit, can contribute to growth in that area. What do I want to write about? Honestly I have no clue yet but it should be mostly stuffs related to my discipline and or other personal interest. Only time will tell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lastly, As shared by <a href="http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/">David Robinson</a>, aspiring data scientist ought to consider some sort of micro-blogging to help career visibility. The statement rings true for all professional beyond data science practitioners. I might as well as start building my digital presence now for future sake. Hopefully, I stay long enough beyond some couple of post and try updating this space.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p align = "center" > That being said, I welcome you to this corner of the web.</></p>
