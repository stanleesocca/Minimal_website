      <p>Why blog? This question have been a recurring theme in my head for a while. I have procastinated long enough to answer this question but I never manage to do so. One of my mentor/lecturer, once commented that I take my scientific writting serious after reading through my MSc dissertation. Of course, her comment were for good reason so don&rsquo;t get the last statement wrong. That&rsquo;s being established, below summarise briefly some of the motivation behind exposing myself to the world wide web:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Firstly, Human live and breathe communication. As social species, we clamour to be heard, our voices to be loud, our ideas and our perspective to be considered. This disposition is even more obvious in this bespoken <del>mis</del>information age. But, more pertinent to me is the the need for me and by extension other scientist and any professional for that matter; to share and broadcast our work to the general public. I think sharing bits and pieces of my work is noble endeavour. Personally, I can&rsquo;t imagine being a scientist and having my work only archived in super technical form (aka scientific journal). The general populace ought to share in the euphoria our work too and how can we engage them in a simplified manner? Tough question ðŸ¤”, you bet. This is where my personal notes comes in. The idea is to share brief content of my research and other interesting studies in my own simple way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondly and more personally is my growing obsession to scientific literary. This is one area I personally would loved to improved upon. Sadly, little of this get much attention in traditional academia. &ldquo;<em>You grow into the job with practice</em>&rdquo; says the good old veteran. So, I might as well start practicing now and who knows, may get better in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thirdly, lately my penchant on subject of computational biogeochemistry coincide with my new project in LSCE. As biogeochemist are often find themselves working with model of ever-interesting complexity, I feel this is a good opportunity to narrate and share my experience working with the computa beast. I notice, there is scanty information on web about marine ecosystem model from a perspective for beginners. I hope some of the stuff in my notes will useful to others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope some of the reason resonate with you. In conclusion, I reckon writing  as skills is a lifelong craft that constantly need improvement. The above reasons underline the raison d&rsquo;etre of why I did decided to toll this road. See you around âœŒ</p>
