Finally, it is happening…
</p> 

A breath of unfamiliar air is blown across the entire oceanography and marine science community. One which arrival could inspire generation to come. The sort of paradigm shift which if  supported by all and sundry can lead to a discipline that is not only inclusive but can really harness its talent pool across geographical and racial spectrum.

Shortly arriving in Europe to pursue my masters, the realisation of being a lone ranger in this field loom large :worried:. And perhaps understandable, given the little incentive and motivation for older generations (at least from where I come from) to imagine spending time studying phytoplankton diversity, crab morphology, shark swimming pattern, benthic-pelagic coupling or mixed layer dynamics as well as other “mundane and vague” topic out there in the field. I get words like *“job ain’t paying quick like…”*. The case gets scarier when there are not many people from your *"hood"* sharing the same excitement as you when there is any conversation in those topics.

<p align="center">So, why invest in such a degree?  Why invest in a such as idea? such fantasy?</></p>

However, the tides seem to be changing. Earlier this year, a fairly random tweet by Dr Tiara Moore, asking if there was ever thing like “a black in marine science” spark a chain of reaction that resonate with a lot of fellows around the ocean science community. The net result is the first #BlackinMarineScience week that seek to celebrate the excellence and success of minorities in this discipline. This event and the conversations that will ensue can be follow on twitter and other channels ([website](https://blackinmarsci.github.io/), [twitter page with the hashtag #BlackinMarineScience](https://twitter.com/BlackinMarSci)) from 29th of November – 5th of December 2020.

In my opinion, this is a fantastic initiative to increase representative and inspire each other. Finally, I feel the voices and faces are coming out. A community that feels what I feel, understand some of my perception, and inclination. 

I could not be any happier as this new month begin. I look forward to getting to see a different side of marine science this week. Maybe get to know some, network and exchange ideas and vibes. I will try to keep tab of the happening and probably write a follow afterward. 

The wind of change is slowly hitting the shore in this field. I can feel it. Can you?
