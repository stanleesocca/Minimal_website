Why this? Why write?

Honestly, I never meant to go this way. I'm not even sure why I am doing this. I have been much of a recluse for long to suddenly charge off to the internet to start anything remotely close to blogging. However, during the summer of 2020 amidst the COVID pandemic, I became too bored and I decided to learn some new stuff. Refreshen my CSS skills, Latex, Julia and a bit of Good O'l Fortran. The result of such summer experiment is what you are reading. 

On a more serious tone, the question of expressing myself in my own terms have been a recurring theme in my headspace for a while. I have procrastinated for much long to try something in that direction. Needless to say, I never manage to do so. But somehow, I managed to find time to create this little corner of the web for my own fancy. Below are some words I say to justify why I had to toll this path. 

- Firstly, as I continue my scientific training at LSCE, I feel this space can be a landing page for some of my scientific and other related activities. Obviously, this will be a journey that I both relish and look forward to. I hope so curate some of my successes (aka publication links when they finally come), stories, experiences as well as challenge faced while on this. Who knows some stuffs here might be useful for others? Finger crossed on this :v:

- Also, I hope to used this medium to learn and improve on my verbal skills. Communication and writting as skills often relegated to side in my bucket list of "to-do". I believe writing here when time permit, can help improve such skills. What do I want to write? Honestly I have no clue but mostly will be stuff related to my discipline and interest. Some personal thought about science, programming, and perhaps other tangential preoccupation. Time will tell.

- Lastly, As shared by [David Robinson]("http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/"), aspiring data scientist ought to consider blogging to help careers visibility. The statement rings true for all professional beyond data science practitioners, I might as well as start building my digital presence now for future sake. Hopefully, I stay long enough beyond some couple of post and strive to keep updating this space. 

That being said, I welcome you to this corner of the web.
