Hi, my name is Stanley, a grad student with African root, hatched in the Lagos, Nigeria and living as an academic normad ever since. I'm interested in understanding how our marine system works, especially in aspect of biogeochemistry and ecology.

I decided to create this blog to help practice my communication skills as I navigate this academic terrain. So, In essence this space will be a hub for joggling some of my thoughts, experiences and things that I'm currently learning about in marine science space. Occassionally, I will use this hub to flesh out some of the concept learnt through my academic itinerary. 

So what to expect. Anything from short note, prose-like article, some programming codes (Yes, that's my side-habit) and generally things i like. You can follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/nmorstanlee)
