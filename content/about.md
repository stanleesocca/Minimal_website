Hi, my name is Stanley. I'm a PhD student in Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement (LSCE). My overarching interest lies in the intersection of physics, ecology and biogeochemistry in the marine environment. Currently, I will be working on aspect of sediment biogeochemical modelling.  

I decided to create this space as a landing page for my work. Occassionally, I will share some personal experiences/story as I journey on this academic terrain.
