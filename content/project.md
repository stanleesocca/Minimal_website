# **Previous project**

These are some recent project I have worked or still working on. 

* **Investigating Coral Community Change and Potential Recovery Following Mass Coral Bleaching and Mortality Event-Chagos Archipelagos case study**
  * Involved in project investigating the response of coral communities after episodic external
  disturbances with the charming [Dr Catherine Head](https://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/people/dr-catherine-head) of    University of Oxford, UK as part  of my professional practice in the [International Masters in    Marine Biological resources](www.imbrsea.eu) programme. 
  * I also developed a simple, coral ID web app for fun at the end of the project. I named it [Coralipedia]("https://stanlee.shinyapps.io/Coralipedia/"). Obviously, it can be better. If you have any ideas, reach out.

* **Modelling the contribution of Microphytobenthos in Sediment biogeochemistry**
  * I worked with the incredible [Dr Karline Soetaert](https://www.nioz.nl/en/about/organisation/staff/karline-soetaert) of Royal Netherland of Sea Research in improving   the representation of biological component in classic early diagenesis benthic model. 
  * If you are interested in benthic ecosystem modelling/sediment diagenesis, I would be glad if   you can contact me to know more about this project. 
  
* **Applied Numerical modeling of early diagenesis and benthic-pelagic coupling in sedimentary systems**
  * This project at the [OCEANIS group](https://www.lsce.ipsl.fr/Phocea/Vie_des_labos/Ast/ast_groupe.php?id_groupe=145) will be my current focus for the next coming years. I will be supervised by [Dr Christophe Rabouille](https://www.lsce.ipsl.fr/Phocea/Pisp/index.php?nom=christophe.rabouille) and [Dr Eric Viollier](https://www.ipgp.fr/fr/viollier-eric). Finger crossed on this one.
